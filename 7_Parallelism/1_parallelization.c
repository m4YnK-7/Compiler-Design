/*
Parallelized Array Processing with Pthreads and Vectorization:

Implement a parallel array processing program where tasks like summing or finding the maximum of an array are divided among multiple threads using Pthreads.
Add SIMD vectorization (using intrinsics) to further optimize the computation within each thread, leveraging vectorization for faster processing.
