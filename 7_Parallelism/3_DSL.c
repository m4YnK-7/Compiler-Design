/*

Basic DSL Interpreter with Instruction Scheduling:

Design a simple domain-specific language (DSL) for arithmetic expressions, then write a C program that interprets and evaluates expressions written in this DSL.
Implement instruction scheduling within the interpreter to reorder operations for efficiency, simulating a software pipeline to minimize delays.
Use this project to explore how language design impacts performance and how compilers can optimize instruction execution.
